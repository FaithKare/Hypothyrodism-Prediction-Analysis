A Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. The data was to be then used to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroidism.

The following steps will be undertaken during this study:
Data loading, exploration and cleaning 
Exploratory data analysis 
Modelling using Decison trees ( Random forests , ADABoosting , Gradient Boosting) and Support Vector Machine ( linear , polynomial , radial basis function
